\section*{Read Carefully. Important!}

\noindent By electronically uploading this assignment to Brightspace you acknowledge these statements and accept any repercussions if in any violation of ANY Purdue Academic Misconduct policies. You must upload your homework on time for it to be graded. No late assignments will be accepted. {\bf Only the last uploaded version of your assignment before the due date will be graded}.

\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent {\bf NOTE:} You should aim to submit no later than 30 minutes before the deadline, as there could be last minute network traffic that would cause your assignment to be late, resulting in a grade of zero. 

\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent When submitting your assignment it is assumed that every student considers the below checklist, as there are grading consequences otherwise (e.g., not submitting a cover sheet is an automatic grade of ZERO).

\begin{todolist}

    \item Your solutions were prepared using the \LaTeX template provided in Brightspace. 
    \item Your submission has a cover sheet as its first page and this checklist as its second page, according to the template provided.
	 \item All of your solutions (program code, etc.) are included in the submission as requested. % Check this checkbox and the following ones if satisfied <---
    \item You have not included any screen shots, photos, etc. (plots should be intermediately saved as .png files and then added into your .tex file). % <---
	 \item  All math notation and algorithms (algorithmic environment) are created using appropriate \LaTeX code (no pictures, handwritten solutions, etc.). % <---
    \item  The .pdf is submitted as an individual file and not in a {\tt .zip}.
    \item You kept the \LaTeX source code in your files until this assignment is graded, in case you are required to show proof of creating your assignment using \LaTeX.  % <---
    \item If submitting with a partner, your partner is added in the submission section in Gradescope after you upload your file. % <---
    \item You have correctly matched each question to its page \# in the .pdf submission in the Gradescope section (after you uploaded your file).
    \item  Watch videos on creating pseudocode if you need a refresher or quick reference to the idea. These are good starter videos:    % <---
